# NuPIC Wallboard

This is a Node.js application used as a one-stop location to view the status of the [NuPIC open source project](http://numenta.org/nupic.html).

## Work in Progress

This is a minimal framework using jquery, express, underscore, handlebars, and bootstrap. I'm just getting the main parts down.

## TODO

- status of all running builds in travis
- numenta.org website status check
- recent commits on github
- open PRs on github
- current contributor count
- mailing list statistics
- recent mailing list messages
- automatic refreshing of monitors
